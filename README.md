# Mini_Project-Accidention_Prevention_Device

Developed an innovative device that detects eye blink patterns and alerts the User with buzzing and LED lighting if excessive time is taken. Utilized Arduino language for software development and Arduino board for hardware implementation.


# Working 

The device is in the form of Goggles wore in late night driving or while long riding situations. The IR sensor is attached in a way so that it detects the light reflecting from the eyes, whenever this light gets stopped due to closing of eye lids because of sleepyness, etc. the Arduino nano intiates the signal for turning ON LED light & Buzzer which alerts the User which will prevent any accident from happening. This Arduino nano is coded in its language so that when the eye lids gets closed for a certain interval (0.5s) then it will initiate the signal to alert the user.
